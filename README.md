# Multiple videos for Youtube

Playing around with Youtube api I've created this small app... it shows four youtube channels at the same time.

## Usage

1) Copy a Youtube video link.
2) Back in app, press Q, W, A or S to paste link in top-left, top-right, bottom-left or bottom-right quadrant respectively.
3) You can play four videos simultaneously, moving mouse around the screen will unmute each video when mouse hovers over each player.
4) This behaviour can be activated/deactivated pressing M key.
5) Responsive design for any screen, there is a tiny gap between four players and screen borders so you can move mouse around without affecting sound.
